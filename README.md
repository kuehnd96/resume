# resume
This repo contains my master resume in MS Word and .pdf formats. It has everything relevant that I have done in my career that fits in the context of a resume. Whenever I apply for a job I remove irrelevant items to get it down to two pages or less. Doing this over and over has proven to be a good way of discovering what should and shouldn't be on this resume.

Time will tell if I can resist the urge to add issues in this repo for changes; I am a big believer in organization.
